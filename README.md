<h2>Description</h2>

This website was created to showcase what I have learned so far. This page will serve as a portfolio for future projects I work on and can showcase throughout this program.

<h2>My Experience</h2>

This is my second homework assignment and my task was to build this website from scratch while utilizing bootstrap. I implemented grids, cards, images, rows, columns and forms among other elements. I enjoyed the creativity aspect of this assignment and tried my best to replicate the website from the images provided.
