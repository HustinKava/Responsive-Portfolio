                                <p>Originally born and raised in London, England, Hustin Kava moved to Alberta, Canada at the age of thirteen. Having dual citizenship has granted him the flexibility of travelling back and forth and living the best of both worlds.</p>

Hustin is very passionate about cars. He is intrigued by the various mechanisms involved and cannot go a day without driving his car.</p>

                                <p>In his free time, Hustin enjoys listening to music, with his  favourite genre being Hip Hop. He is currently pursuing a career as a Full Stack Developer and has found the program that he is enrolled in to be quite stimulating thus far. He enjoys challenges and being pushed beyond his limits.

He is grateful that his instructors and classmates provide great support and want to see him succeed.</p>

                                <p>Hustin is excited to see where this new adventure takes hims and is looking forward to sharpening his skills set. The creative aspect of designing websites fascinates him and he is eager to learn how to implement JavaScript.</p>
